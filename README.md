## Objective

As a part of my path to PNPT by TCM Security, we were introduced to scanning and enumartion with a lab using a vulnerable machine called Kioptrix. We used the "Kioptrix: Level 1" vulnerable machine from VulnHub, which is is a great resource for hacking. The object of the game is to acquire root access via any means possible (except actually hacking the VM server or player).

### Skills Learned

- Scanning with Nmap.
- Enumerating HTTP and HTTPS.
- Enumerating SMB.
- Enumerating SSH.
- Researching Potential Vulnerabilities.

### Tools Used

- Nmap which is a vulnerability scanning tool used to discover hosts, open ports, operating systems and services, and detecting vulnerabilties.
