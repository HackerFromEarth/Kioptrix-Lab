## Objective

As a part of my path to PNPT by TCM Security, we were introduced to scanning and enumartion with a lab using a vulnerable machine called Kioptrix. We used the "Kioptrix: Level 1" vulnerable machine from VulnHub, which is is a great resource for hacking. The objective of the lab was to simply scan the device and enumerate the open ports for HTTP/S and SMB. The most important part was learning the tools and developing the methodology for the use of the tools to target hosts.

### Skills Learned

- Scanning with Nmap.
- Enumerating HTTP and HTTPS.
- Enumerating SMB.
- Researching Potential Vulnerabilities after the lab.

### Tools Used

- Nmap - A vulnerability scanning tool used to discover hosts, open ports, operating systems and services, and detecting vulnerabilties.
- Netdiscover - Tool to identify all hosts on the subnet inquired.
- Nikto - Command which is a web server vulnerability scanner.
- DirBuster - Tool used to brute force directories and file names on web/application servers.
- BurpSuite - Tool used for security assessments/penetration testing of web applications.
- Metasploit - Penetration testing framework used for identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks. In this case just identifying.
- smbclient - Command-line utility to intereact with and access resources on networks that use Server Message Block (SMB).
